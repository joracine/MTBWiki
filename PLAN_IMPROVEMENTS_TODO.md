# MTB Wiki - Plan Improvements TODO Tracker

## ðŸŸ¢ High-Impact, Actionable Improvements

### 1. **Parallelize Early Phases**
- [x] Allow admin interface and GraphQL API to be developed in parallel after initial schema is defined
- [x] Enable iterative feedback between API and admin UI

### 2. **Testing Strategy**
- [x] Add explicit unit/integration/e2e test steps to each phase
- [x] Define minimum test coverage goals for each package
- [x] Add contract tests for GraphQL API

### 3. **Dev Experience & Tooling**
- [x] Add a single command for local dev setup (`npm run dev:all`)
- [x] Document how to run/test each service locally

### 4. **Secrets Management**
- [x] Add AWS Secrets Manager setup to early infra phase
- [x] Document local/dev/prod secrets handling

### 5. **Monitoring & Observability**
- [x] Add basic logging/monitoring hooks (CloudWatch, Sentry) from the start
- [x] Ensure error tracking is available in dev and beta

### 6. **Data Migration & Versioning**
- [x] Add process for versioning and updating enumeration seed data
- [x] Add migration scripts for enum changes (e.g., new tags, new regions)
- [x] Document schema versioning and migration process

### 7. **User/Contributor Onboarding**
- [x] Add a "Getting Started" section for new contributors (devs and content editors)
- [x] Document how to add new enumerations, seed data, or content types

### 8. **Review Checkpoints**
- [x] Add explicit review checkpoint after each major phase (local dev, beta deploy, prod deploy)
- [x] Checklist for what to review at each checkpoint (tests, docs, infra, data integrity)

### 9. **Backup & Recovery (Simple Model)**
- [x] Add automated daily snapshot for Aurora (retention: 7 days)
- [x] Add S3 versioning and lifecycle policy for admin interface and docs
- [x] Document manual recovery steps (restore snapshot, re-deploy infra)

### 10. **Internationalization (l11n/i18n)**
- [x] Add i18n support to admin interface from the start (Next.js i18n routing)
- [x] Add language field to all user-facing content tables (e.g., System, Route, Guide)
- [x] Document how to add new languages and translate content

### 11. **Data Schema Versioning**
- [x] Add schema version field to all major tables (e.g., System, Route, Trail)
- [x] Document schema versioning policy (how to bump, how to migrate)
- [x] Add migration scripts for schema changes

### 12. **Remove Transient Data**
- [x] Remove transient/ephemeral data (e.g., weather updates, real-time trail status) from the data model
- [x] Ensure data model focuses on durable, long-lived content

### 13. **Trail Status Sourcing**
- [x] Trail status should reference Trailforks as the authoritative source
- [x] Do not store trail status as durable data; link to Trailforks for current status

## ðŸŸ¢ Notes
- All new tests (unit, integration, e2e, contract) must run automatically on push and deploy via CI/CD (GitHub Actions).
- This tracker is temporary and will be merged into the main execution plan after review.
- All tasks are actionable and technical; "soft" tasks (e.g., stakeholder review) are omitted.
- Solutions are kept simple and cost-effective (e.g., Aurora snapshots, S3 versioning, manual restore docs).
- Data schema versioning and i18n are included from the start for future-proofing.
