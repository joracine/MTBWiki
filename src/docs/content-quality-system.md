# MTB Wiki Content Quality System

## Overview

MTB Wiki aims for Wikipedia-level quality through a multi-layered system of verification, peer review, and reputation building. The goal is crowd-sourced content with a high quality bar.

## üèÜ Quality Control Mechanisms

### 1. **Local Credibility System**
- **Verified Locals**: Contributors can be verified as actual locals by other verified users
- **Expertise Tags**: Specific areas of knowledge (technical trails, XC routes, seasonal conditions)
- **Reputation Scoring**: Built over time through quality contributions
- **Trust Levels**: Earn ability to make direct edits without review

### 2. **Multi-Factor Quality Scoring**
Each piece of content receives scores based on:
- **Completeness**: Required fields and sections filled
- **Freshness**: How recently updated/verified
- **Peer Reviews**: Ratings from other contributors
- **Author Credibility**: Based on local knowledge and track record
- **Community Votes**: Helpful vs not helpful
- **Fact Checking**: Verified claims vs disputes

### 3. **Peer Review Process**
- Reviews rate accuracy, completeness, and clarity (1-5 scale)
- Reviewers provide specific feedback and corrections
- "Personally verified" flag for recent first-hand experience
- Reviews weighted by reviewer's credibility for that system

### 4. **Editorial Workflow**
Content moves through stages:
1. **Draft**: Initial creation
2. **Pending Review**: Submitted for community review
3. **Published**: Approved and live
4. **Featured**: Exceptional content highlighted
