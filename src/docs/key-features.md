# MTB Wiki - Key Features & Unique Value

## üéØ Core Innovation: Regional Context & Nuanced Difficulty

### 1. **Regional Difficulty Calibration**
- **Problem**: A "blue" trail in Squamish would be double-black in California
- **Solution**: Each system includes `difficulty_calibration` rating
- **Value**: Riders know what they're getting into before they arrive

### 2. **Three-Axis Difficulty System**
Instead of a single color rating, we break difficulty into:

#### XC Technical (0-5)
- Measures technical climbing difficulty
- Examples: Utah's punchy ledge climbs, technical rock moves going UP
- Notes explain the specific challenges

#### Descent Technical (0-5)  
- Natural technical features going down
- Examples: PNW roots and rocks, exposure, steep chutes
- Separate from flow/jump difficulty

#### Flow/Jump (0-5)
- Built features, jumps, berms, flow
- Examples: Bike park jump lines, machine-built flow
- Helps flow seekers vs. tech seekers find their trails

#### Fitness Demands
- Not just distance - vertical gain and sustained climbing
- Helps set realistic expectations

## üó∫Ô∏è What We DON'T Duplicate from Trailforks

### We Skip:
- GPS tracks and detailed mapping
- Turn-by-turn navigation  
- Exact trail statistics
- Real-time condition reports
- User check-ins

### We Add:
- **Local Beta**: "Take the left line through the rock garden"
- **Personality**: "Relentless tech fest" vs "Smooth sailing with surprises"
- **Context**: "Like Porcupine Rim's technical sections"
- **Timing**: "Afternoon rides get tacky as dew burns off"
- **Mistakes to Avoid**: "Don't start here on day 1"

## üìç System-Level Discovery

### Character Summary
2-3 sentences that capture the soul of a riding area

### Hidden Gems
The stuff that's not obvious from looking at a trail map

### Common Mistakes  
What visiting riders consistently get wrong

### Regional Context
How this area's trails compare to global standards

## üö¥ Route Curation

### Not Just Trail Lists
- **Why** this specific combination works
- **Experience notes** from locals
- **Condition sensitivity** - when it's best
- **Who it's for** (and who should skip it)

### Key Trails with Purpose
- Not every trail on the route - just the highlights
- Why each trail is included
- Local tips for each section

## üåç Regional Comparisons

### Translation Guide
- "Squamish Blue = Sedona Black"
- Helps riders calibrate expectations

### Key Differences
- Climbing styles (sustained vs punchy)
- Surface conditions (roots vs rocks)
- Weather impacts

## üí° Use Case Examples

### Planning a Trip to Unknown Region
"I ride blacks in California. What should I ride in Squamish?"
- Wiki explains regional rating differences
- Suggests appropriate routes based on actual difficulty
- Warns about common surprises

### Finding Similar Riding
"I love the technical climbing in St. George. Where else?"
- Search by XC technical rating
- Find systems with similar elevation profiles
- Discover new areas with comparable challenges

### Local Knowledge Gap
"I'm visiting Sedona next week. What do I need to know?"
- Prime season timing
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Hidden gems beyond the famous trails
- Condition sensitivities

## üéØ The Sweet Spot

We're not trying to be:
- A GPS navigation app
- A social riding tracker
- A trail condition reporter

We ARE trying to be:
- The bridge between "I want to ride there" and "I had an amazing ride"
- The local friend who knows all the secrets
- The difficulty translator between regions
- The experience curator

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Content Collection**
   - Start with 5-10 systems you know intimately
   - Focus on depth of local knowledge
   - Capture the personality of each area

2. **Validation**
   - Test difficulty ratings with riders from different regions
   - Verify route recommendations make sense
   - Check if regional comparisons resonate

3. **Technical Build**
   - Simple data entry interface
   - Basic search/filter by preferences
   - Route visualization (not mapping, just trail sequence)
