# MTB Wiki - Progress Log

## üìÖ **Session History**

### **Session 1** - *Planning & Architecture*
**Date**: Current Session  
**Duration**: ~2 hours  
**Focus**: Architecture decisions and execution planning

#### **Accomplishments**
- ‚úÖ Defined project concept and core innovation (3-axis difficulty + regional calibration)
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive TypeScript data models
- ‚úÖ Analyzed hosting costs and optimized from $570/month ‚Üí $17/month
- ‚úÖ Decided on Aurora Serverless v2 vs DynamoDB (Aurora wins for relational data)
- ‚úÖ Finalized ultra-low-cost architecture
- ‚úÖ Created detailed 6-phase implementation plan
- ‚úÖ Established repository structure and context tracking system
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: Integrated GraphQL API strategy throughout
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: Designed auto-documentation generation pipeline
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: Configured context tracking in git with hooks
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: Normalized data model with proper enumerations and foreign keys
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: Parallelized admin interface and API development after schema definition
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: Added iterative feedback checkpoints after each major phase
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: Explicit testing strategy with coverage goals and contract tests for GraphQL API
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: Improved dev experience with one-command local dev setup and CI/CD test automation
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: Implemented secure secrets management using AWS Secrets Manager for database credentials and environment variables
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: Added comprehensive monitoring and observability with CloudWatch for logging/metrics and Sentry for error tracking

#### **Key Decisions Made**
1. **Database**: Aurora Serverless v2 (PostgreSQL) - perfect for complex discovery queries
2. **Architecture**: Ultra-low-cost ($17/month) - Lambda in public subnets, no NAT Gateway
3. **Environments**: Beta + Production (not 4 environments - over-engineered)
4. **Frontend**: S3 + CloudFront (not Vercel - saves $17/month)
5. **Repository**: Monorepo with workspaces for better organization
6. **NEW - API**: GraphQL single endpoint (not REST) - perfect for complex discovery queries
7. **NEW - Documentation**: Auto-generated from source code (TypeDoc + GraphQL + Prisma)
8. **NEW - Context Tracking**: Git hooks + automated progress logging
9. **NEW - Data Model**: Normalized with enumerations as tables with foreign keys (not free text)
10. **NEW - Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure, CI/CD, and builds defined as code
11. **NEW - Parallel Dev**: Admin interface and API developed in parallel after schema, with review checkpoints
12. **NEW - Testing Strategy**: Explicit unit/integration/e2e/contract tests, coverage goals, and contract testing for GraphQL API
13. **NEW - Dev Experience**: One-command local dev setup, local run/test docs, all tests run in CI/CD
14. **NEW - Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager setup for secure credential storage and injection
15. **NEW - Monitoring & Observability**: Basic logging, metrics, and error tracking (CloudWatch, Sentry) from the start

#### **Files Created/Updated**
- `src/types/` - Complete TypeScript models
- `src/docs/` - Architecture documentation
- `src/examples/` - Sample data and regional examples
- `EXECUTION_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive implementation plan (updated with GraphQL + docs, secrets management details, and monitoring/observability details)
- `PROGRESS_LOG.md` - This file (updated with new decisions)
- `README.md` - Project overview (updated with GraphQL architecture and testing workflow, local dev setup, secrets management, and monitoring/observability)
- `docs-config.md` - **NEW**: Complete documentation and GraphQL integration strategy
- `.gitignore` - **NEW**: Configured for proper documentation tracking
- `src/types/normalized-models.ts` - **NEW**: Normalized data model with enumerations and foreign keys
- `src/examples/enumeration-seed-data.ts` - **UPDATED**: Comprehensive seed data for all enumerations
- `EXECUTION_PLAN.md` - **UPDATED**: Added comprehensive Infrastructure as Code strategy and parallel dev workflow
- `infrastructure-as-code-config.md` - **NEW**: Detailed IaC configuration with CDK stacks and GitHub Actions

#### **Next Session Goals**
- Initialize git repository
- Create monorepo structure
- Begin Phase 1: Local development setup

## üéØ **Current Status**

### **Phase**: Planning Complete ‚úÖ
### **Next Phase**: Phase 1 - Local Development Setup
### **Estimated Timeline**: 8 weeks total
### **Current Week**: Ready to start Week 1

## üìä **Metrics Tracking**

### **Cost Optimization**
- Original estimate: $570-1020/month
- First optimization: $206/month
- Free tier correction: $123.50/month
- **Final ultra-optimized**: $17/month (87% cost reduction!)

### **Architecture Decisions**
- Database technology: 3 options considered ‚Üí Aurora Serverless v2 selected
- Hosting approach: 4 options analyzed ‚Üí S3+CloudFront selected
- Environment strategy: 4 environments ‚Üí 2 environments
- Network architecture: VPC with NAT ‚Üí Public Lambda (saves $45/month)

## üîÑ **Change Log**

### **Major Architecture Changes**
1. **Cost Optimization Round 1**: Reduced environments 4‚Üí2, switched from AppSync to Lambda
2. **Cost Optimization Round 2**: Added AWS free tier calculations
3. **Cost Optimization Round 3**: Ultra-low-cost architecture with public Lambda
4. **Database Decision**: Comprehensive Aurora vs DynamoDB analysis

### **Scope Refinements**
- Focused on discovery/curation vs competing with Trailforks
- Emphasized regional difficulty calibration as key differentiator
- Prioritized local knowledge and commentary over raw trail data
